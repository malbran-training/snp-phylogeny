    "_Chlamydia trachomatis_ is one of the most prevalent human pathogens in the world, causing a variety of infections. It is the leading cause of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with an estimated 131 million new cases each year. Additionally, it is also the leading cause of preventable infectious blindness with tens of millions of people thought to have active disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the most commonly used tool for typing _C. trachomatis_ isolates was serotyping using the MOMP (major outer membrane protein), which is encoded by the ompA gene. There are two biovars of C. trachomatis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the _trachoma_ biovar includes ocular and urogenital strains, which cause the majority of trachoma and STIs, and are characterised by localised infections of the epithelial surface of the conjunctiva or genital mucosa;\n",
    "* the _lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)_ biovar includes strains which are distinguished by their ability to spread systemically thorough the lymphatic system, causing genital ulceration and bubonic disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on MOMP serotyping, _C.trachomatis_ has been subdivided into between 15 and 19 serotypes: the _trachoma_ biovar includes ocular serotypes A to C and urogenital serotypes D to K, while the _LGV_ biovar includes serotypes L1, L2 (including L2a, b and c) and L3. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have sequence data for a variety of _C.trachomatis_ isolates and we want to look at the relationship between these isolates. Included in the dataset is sequence data for a New Variant of _C. trachomatis_ (known as NV) which caused a European health alert in 2006. During this time it became the dominant strain circulating in some European countries and began to spread worldwide. The reason for this was that it evaded detection by the widely used PCR-based diagnostic test."

    "Before any phylogenetic analysis, we must make sure that the columns in our data represent homologous bases. With gene or protein sequence data, this usually means aligning the nucleotide or amino acid sequences using a multiple alignment program. Length differences of the sequences complicate multiple sequence alignment because these require the insertion of gaps into an alignment to ensure that homologous sites remain aligned. When possible, alignments should be checked by eye.\n",

The bootstrapping values indicates how many times out of 100, the same branch was observed when repeating the phylogenetic reconstruction on the re-sampled set of your data. Robust relationship should be repeatable, and subsequently observed in a large proportion of randomised data. Therefore, if you get 100 out of 100 times for a particular node, you can be more confident that the observed branch is not due to chance, but likely to be real.\n",

The processing of the 10 replicates may take a few minutes, so you could move on while this is running. Ideally you would run more replicates (100 or 1000), but to save time we will only run 10 replicates here.\n",
